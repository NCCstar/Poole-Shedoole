Hello, I am Emilia Cabrera presenting for the PUT Programming Team.

Our Schedule Picker is straightforward and easy to use.

Our simplistic interface proudly shows our school colors without creating a distraction for the user 
	and allows the page to load quickly on any device.

With a full list of classes, based on the freshman course selection sheet, 
simply select your classes, clubs and sports, and click (click Anime, Baseball and English 9 HN, Algebra 1, World History & Geography HN)
	on the button marked "GENERATE" at the top of the screen to display your potential schedule

With a generated Schedule, the time requirements and differences in odd and even days are displayed clearly with color coded boxes. 

The schedule displays two weeks of information to allow for the user to plan for clubs and after school 
	activities that occur bimonthly, such as anime club.

The boxes include a title at the top to inform the user of what activity is being displayed. 

The homework slot is a total of the amount of homework every week, divided by the number of days to provide
	an approximation of the time needed to complete the homework for the selected classes.

Conflicts are shown clearly in bright red, allowing for the user to easily find any conflicts created.
On Top of the interface being easy to use, the code is easily modifiable.

With a few simple changes to the information in the database, our project can be modified to allow the use
	by students other than freshmen who want to plan out their schedule as well.

As times change and classes are added and removed, the code has been set up to allow for faculty
	to easily edit the database to update information for future Woodson Students.


I hope you enjoyed our presentation and find value in this Schedule Picker.
